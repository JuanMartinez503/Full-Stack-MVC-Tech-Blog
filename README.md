# Full-Stack-MVC-Tech-Blog

## Description
- My task was to make a CMS-style blog site , where users can publish their thoughts and comments. User's can also update and delete their post.
- The website was built from scratch.
- The website uses custom CSS, bootstrap 5 CSS, used handlebars for the views section, and Javascript for the front-end, and node.js/express.js for the backend.
